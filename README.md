# Wine-Quality
Determine quality of the wine through various Classification techniques

I have used a wine dataset from Kaggle, which has both, numerical as well as categorical variables and it has real-world applications. It can be used for advertising Vineyards or Winery and focusing on creating products that have components on improving wine quality. In our project, we focus on improving the quality of the wine, which would lead to an improvement in revenue.
